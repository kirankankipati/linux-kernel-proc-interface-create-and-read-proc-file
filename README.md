Sample Linux Kernel Module to create and read a sample /proc file as discussed in my YouTube video. /proc is one of the most popular kernel to user-space interface which you can leverage to add an interface to your Kernel code such as Kernel modules, Kernel Device Drivers, etc. Personally I prefer /proc interface than other alternatives such as /sysfs, ioctl() and so on for my personal Kernel modules/stack.

Disclaimer: Of course if you just download and try this source on to any modern Linux distro comes with respective kernel, it may not work. Since as I always say in my videos, Linux Kernel is every evolving constantly changing source-code. Its nothing like user-space programming. So this example source which I wrote and discussed in the video is compatible for that version of the kernel. So kindly refer my article (link below) for further instructions, porting guidelines, and so on.
